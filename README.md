# Election-Meddlng COMING-SOON

Twiter based, anonymous (Non API-dependant),  psycological operations proof of concept for mass political profiling and persuation.

### PROGRAM DESIGN:

* Feed Geolocation specific usernames.
* Perform Topic analysis on user's tweets
* Perform sentiment analysys on user≈õ tweets

Topic analysis + sentiment analysis will be used to determine the user's political position.

### Key concept:

If wanted to benefit (A) wing over (B) wing, pro BLANK vote propaganda will be sent - in some manner- to those who tend to the opposite (B) wing, and pro VOTE propaganda to those who tend to (A) wing, resulting in a higher proportion of voes for (A) wing. 


### TO DO:

- Add topic analysis, propaganda function.

The program currently employs Textblob's default naive bayes clasifier for sentiment analysis. A far more advanced solution will be implemented soon.
